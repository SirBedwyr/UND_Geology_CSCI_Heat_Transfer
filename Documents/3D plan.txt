Plan for 3D Implementation (non visualization)

- Currently Gosnold takes the average of two cell dimensions as distance between cell centers where the j'th cell in the X array is the x dimension of one cell (a little kludgy, but it works for this program). We will maintain this in determining distances between centers. Distance formula is sqrt(z^2 + sqrt(x^2+y^2)).

- Average will be (X(j1)+X(j))/2 (Y(i1)+Y(i))/2 and (Z(k1)+Z(k))/2 where j1 is one cell removed in the x direction from j. Note that j and i are reversed from normal convention. We are keeping k the same.

- Cubic orientation will be front-to-back assuming origin of front, top left. When a middle cube is under consideration, the cell number is 14. The cells in front are 1-9, adjacent are 10-18, behind are 19-27. Cell movement for convection is determined from this. Conduction only happens orthagonally.
